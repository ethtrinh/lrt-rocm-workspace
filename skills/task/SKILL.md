description: Use when switching to working on a specific task (project)

Switch to working on task `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. Read the task file at `tasks/active/$ARGUMENTS.md`
2. Write the task name to `.claude/active-task` (just the name, e.g., "ci-pipeline-shard")
3. If the task has a `repositories:` field in YAML frontmatter, note which repos are involved

Review the task context including:
- Current status and goals
- Previous investigation notes
- Any blockers or open questions
- Next steps
- **Repositories involved** (from frontmatter, if present)

Then ask me what I'd like to work on for this task.
